			<p>Zara has announced the release of a brand new cosmetics line just in time for your Christmas shopping.
			<br>
			<br>
			The makeup range has been inspired by the dramatic looks devised by Vogue beauty editor-at-large Pat McGrath 
			for the Zara autumn/winter 2018 campaign, which was shot by Steven Meisel.
			<br>
			<br>
			Zara has followed in the footsteps of other high street retailers such as Topshop and & Other Stories in 
			launching a makeup line that will likely prove popular among consumers. </p>

			<p>
			The collection by the Spanish retailer features a range of pigmented, matte lipsticks and matte liquid lipsticks.
			<br>
			<br>
			Zara explains the inspiration behind the bold lipstick line, highlighting the importance of ensuring that the 
			products in the range are of a high quality and reasonably priced.
			<br>
			<br>
			“During the initial stages of creation Zara sought expert knowledge and guidance from some of the most influential,
			experienced beauty professionals in the industry,” the retailer says.

			<p>“This has resulted in the production of long-lasting, easy to use, matte lipstick shades.
			<br>
			<br>
			“With the new addition of this beauty line Zara aims to provide top quality, innovative, fun and affordable products.”</p>
