			<p>I went to Sephora the other day, looking a good lipstick I could use 
			to complete my makeup look for Halloween. I was initially looking for a shiny, 
			metallic lipstick, but the Sephora I went to, which is very limited in its variety 
			of makeup items, seemed to not have anything I was looking for. Defeated, I decided 
			to look for a backup: a plain black lipstick that I could put glittery eyeshadow on 
			top of. I didn’t want a formula that was too matte, hindering my ability to stick any 
			powder on my lips, but I also wanted a lipstick that would dry down. That is how I found 
			myself at the Sephora Cream Lip Stain stand, facing 90 shades of lipstick. Looking from 
			shelf to shelf, I finally found the staple black shade in the collection, titled Night Bird. 
			I picked up the sample and swatched it on my hand, testing the opacity and finish of the lipstick.

			I was not too worried about the opacity because I already have this brand and model of 
			lipstick in a different shade called Frozen Strawberry (what an interesting name to call 
			a shade of lipstick), and that shade swatched very well on my skin. However, I did wonder
			what the finish was going to be. Frozen Strawberry dried matte on my lips, but it was not 
			the best lipstick to function with. It transferred a lot and wore off quickly with eating 
			and drinking. Nevertheless, I still wanted to give this lipstick a second chance with the 
			shade, since shade formula and finish could differ. Also, I am planning to wear the black 
			lipstick as part of a Halloween costume not to function around with, so I decided not to 
			be as worried about formula. After a few minutes of strolling about the store with the swatch 
			on my hand, I noticed the lipstick dried down to a semi-matte finish, with some slight tackiness to it.

			<p>
			Normally, I would not like this finish for everyday functional wear, but I found this to be 
			perfect for my makeshift Halloween lip look. Knowing that this would be my choice for the black 
			lipstick I needed, I decided to purchase the item, only to see that there weren’t any left. Luckily, 
			after calling an employee over and asking if there were any available in the back, I was able to obtain 
			the last one. Of course, I became even more grateful and eager to buy it. Knowing it was only $14 sweetened
			the deal as well. Compared to other black lipsticks like Fenty Beauty’s Stunna Lip Paint in Uninvited ($24) 
			and Kat Von D’s Everlasting Liquid Lipstick in Witches ($20), I thought that was great for a lipstick.
